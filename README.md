# AEZ implementation for node

This is an implementation of the [http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/aez/](AEZ) authenticated-encryption scheme in JavaScript for node.

The code is based upon [https://github.com/Yawning/aez](Yawning's implementation in Go) and the
[http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/aez/code/v5/aez5_software.zip](reference implementation in C). 

I am by no means an expert in high performance JavaScript or the underlying cryptography. So this library might be really slow.

**Work in progress, do not use yet!**
